                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        More than two decades ago, Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius started a web design agency called the
                        Rocket Science Group. Their focus was on big, corporate clients, but on the side, they created a
                        delightful email marketing service for small businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mailchimp was designed as an alternative to the oversized, expensive email software of the early
                        2000s. Founded in Atlanta in 2001, it offered small business owners access to many of the same
                        digital marketing advantages that their much larger competitors enjoyed, powering their success
                        and
                        enabling them to grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the years that followed, Mailchimp continued to deliver results for budding entrepreneurs.
                        But
                        just as those original customers continued to grow, so did Mailchimp, evolving its product
                        offerings
                        to serve companies and marketing teams of all sizes and skill levels. In 2021, Mailchimp was
                        acquired by Intuit, a company with a long track record of driving small business success and
                        solving
                        customer problems. Today, we continue to empower the underdog and strive to be the business
                        partner
                        we wish we had way back in the beginning.

                        Intuit Mailchimp strives to create a culture that empowers a humble, creative, and independent
                        workforce. We are passionate about our small business customers and believe that collaboration
                        and
                        creativity are powerful tools to help them make their dreams a reality.

                    <p>
                        We love how each new hire adds to our culture. And, we’re hiring.

                    <p>
                        We believe that what makes us different makes us stronger. Building a more diverse, inclusive,
                        and
                        equitable organization is good for our teams, our customers, and our community. We empower each
                        other to bring unique perspectives and experiences to work, and we continually seek new ways to
                        do
                        so.

                        We believe that big change can start small, especially when you Give Where You Live. There are
                        more than 1.5 million nonprofits in the U.S. alone, with the vast majority operating on an
                        annual budget of less than $1 million. Small organizations that are embedded in their
                        communities often have a positive and lasting impact for their cause and the people they serve,
                        many providing critical services in lower-income communities. We know running a small business
                        or nonprofit is challenging on its own, and these organizations were hit hard by a decrease in
                        donations in the wake of the Covid pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a world full of big issues, small world changers need a champion. That’s why Mailchimp has
                        invested more than $15 million to help small and medium sized organizations get started and
                        grow.
