    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>How long is the free trail?</h3>
    <p>The free trial of Standard or Essentials lasts for 14 days. For example, if you start your trial<br>
       on August 29, your trial would end on September 12</p>
       <h3>Can I upgrade or downgrade my plane during the free trail?</h3>
       <p>Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade at any time during your trial. If you upgrade to<br>
         Premium, you’ll just pay the difference in price between the two plans for the remaining<br>
          days of your free trial. Downgrades to your monthly plan go into effect at the end of the<br>
           monthly billing period. You won't receive a refund for previously billed charges, but you’ll <br>
        retain access to those features until the end of the billing period.</p>
