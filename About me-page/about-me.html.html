<h2>Who Am I</h2>
<p>I'm Bar, a 26-year-old passionate learner. I split my time between the world of web development and the world of Muay Thai and gym — and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>

<h2>What I Love</h2>
<p>When I’m not writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you’ll probably find me training hard at the gym or sleeping. I love building things on the web just as much as I love sharpening my fighting skills and dreaming about stuff.</p> 

<h3>A bit more about me</h3>
<p> I'm incredibly excited to dive deeper into the world of web development. Every day I learn something new — whether it's a cool CSS trick, a JavaScript function, or how to organize my code better — and it motivates me to keep going. I love the way this field mixes creativity with logic. I see coding not just as a skill, but as a way to bring my ideas to life and constantly challenge myself. I'm also passionate about training and pushing my limits physically and mentally, whether it's in front of a computer or in the gym. This project is just the beginning — I'm ready for more.</p>
